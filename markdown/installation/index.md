# ðŸ“¦ Installation

This section describes how to install the PDS DOI Service.

## Requirements

Prior to installing this software, ensure your system meets the following
requirements:


* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3. This software requires Python 3; it will work with 3.6, 3.7, or
3.8.  Python 2 will absolutely *not* work.


* `libxml2` version 2.9.2; later 2.9 versions are fine.  Run `xml2-config
--version` to find out.

Consult your operating system instructions or system administrator to install
the required packages. For those without system administrator access and are
feeling anxious, you could try a local (home directory) [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3 installation
using a [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installation.

## Doing the Installation

The easiest way to install this software is to use [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), the Python Package
Installer. If you have Python on your system, you probably already have Pip;
you can run `pip3 --help` to check. Then run:

```
pip3 install pds-doi-core
```

If you donâ€™t want the package dependencies to interfere with your local system
you can also use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)  for your deployment.
To do so:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.virtualenvs
python3 -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
pip3 install pds.deeparchive
```

You can then run `pds-doi-cmd --help` to get a usage message and ensure
itâ€™s properly installed. You can go to the [usage](../usage/index.html) documentation for details.

**NOTE**: The above commands will install last approved release.
To install former releases, you can do:

pip install pds-doi-core==<version>

The released versions are listed on: [https://pypi.org/project/pds-doi-core/#history](https://pypi.org/project/pds-doi-core/#history)

If you want to use the latest unstable version, you can refer to the [development](../development/index.html) documentation

## Upgrade Software

To check and install an upgrade to the software, run the following command in your
virtual environment:

```
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
pip install pds-doi-core --upgrade
```
