# Frequently Asked Questions

This page includes FAQs for the PDS DOI Service. If you require additional support, please contact the [PDS Operator](mailto:pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov) for assistance.


### How do I know whether I should reserve or release a DOI?

The short answer:
* If the data is not yet publicly available -> Reserve
* If the data is publicly available -> Release

The longer answer:
* To "reserve" a DOI, is to get a DOI from our DOI Provider associated with a data set for a future release. This is the ideal start for getting DOIs so you can get the DOI, and then add it to the PDS4 label metadata prior to release.
* To "release" a DOI is to make the https://doi.org/<my_doi> URL live. This requires that the data is registered at EN, available online, and the landing pages are live (automated by EN Registry).

### How can I specify multiple authors in the DOI reserve spreadsheet?

You can just put 1 author in the spreadsheet for now. The only part of that spreadsheet that really matters is the **LIDVID**. That is what ties to the DOI to the product. You will have a chance to update the DOI metadata with as many authors as you'd like at the "Release DOI" step.

### The DOI reserve spreadsheet seems very terse, can I provide more information?

The "Reserve DOI" step is really just a placeholder to request a DOI from our DOI Provider. The only information that is really critical at this step is the LIDVID. Everything else will be updated when you submit a request to "release" the DOI using the PDS4 label.

### What PDS4 products should we be assigning DOIs to?

Per the PDS DOI Policy, bundles are the "default" product to receive a DOI, but it is up to the Discipline Node if you would like DOIs for collections or documents.

### What does it mean to have data registered?

In order for the DOI Landing Pages to be generated, the products must be registered with PDS Engineering Node.

### How do I register my PDS4 product with Engineering Node?

Contact the [PDS Operator](mailto:pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov) with the URL(s) to the applicable PDS4 product(s) you would like registered.
