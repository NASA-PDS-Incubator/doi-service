## Component Description

The PDS Data Object Identifier (DOI) service is responsible for the management of [DOIs](https://www.doi.org/) for the Planetary Data System.

## Use Cases
### Generate DOI Object from PDS4 Label
1. A user posts a bundle bundle/collection/product PDS4 label to the service.
2. The service translates the metadata from the PDS4 label into the DOI/IAD Record Object
3. The service return the IAD record object

### User Submits DOI Object
1. A user posts a DOI/IAD Record object
2. The service verifies validity of the object
3. The service posts the object to the Tracking Service
   1. Alternatively, the service could post the object to a file staging area or just include in email
4. The service notifies Operator of DOI submission
   1. Alternatively, the service could send an email to Operator for manual vetting and submission.

### Operator Reserves DOI Object
1. The authenticated Operator submits a DOI object to the service for reserve DOI
2. The service validates the DOI object
3. The service submit the DOI object to the IAD Service and verifies return values
4. The service posts Reserved DOI information to Tracking Service and forwards response to Operator

### Operator Release DOI Object
1. The authenticated Operator submits a DOI object to the service for release DOI
2. The service validates the DOI object
3. The service submit the DOI object to the IAD Service and verifies return values
4. The service posts Released/Published DOI information to Tracking Service and forwards response to Operator

## Detailed Design

### DOI Service

The DOI Service a RESTful web service that provides the ability to perform the following operations for PDS DOIs:
* Draft a DOI
* Reserve a DOI
* Release a DOI
* Retrieve a DOI
* Update a DOI
* Delete a DOI

#### Update a DOI

TBD

#### Delete a DOI

### Batch Processsing Service

Batch processing service interfaces with the DOI service, and is responsible for perform DOI operations across a large number of products using a pre-defined TBD CSV format for submitting batch metadata.

The batch system will then read in this CSV, and synchronously perform DOI Service operations on the set of product metadata.

### DOI Command-line Client

This client will be used to access the DOI Service from the command-line. All functions available through the DOI Service should be made available from this client interface.
